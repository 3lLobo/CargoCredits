# CargoCredits
Incentive token for green-transport and carbon-offset.


## Roadmap

The project can be divided in two tracqs.
One implements the CargoCredit as ERC20 token on OP, this includes designing the logo ðŸŽ¨

The secont part focuses on the frontend. Optimally we deliver a demo workflow for a user logging in, the GoogleMaps API fetching the travel history and sneding it a express bacqend, where our payMaster wallet distributed the tokens. If we have time we can implement a smart contract to do this instead of an bacqend server.
